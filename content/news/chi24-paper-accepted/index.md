<!-- ```python

``` -->

<!-- ## Organize your notebooks

Place the notebooks that you would like to publish in a `notebooks` folder at the root of your website.

## Import the notebooks into your site

```bash
pipx install academic
academic import 'notebooks/**.ipynb' content/post/ --verbose
``` -->

<!-- The notebooks will be published to the folder you specify above. In this case, they will be published to your `content/post/` folder. -->

We propose a novel computationally rational model that features modeling users' attention switch when multitasking, especially in the context of reading on OHMDs while walking. We develop a hierarchical reinforcement learning architecture to capture users' key cognitive processes and realize them in a physics engine called MuJoCo. The model successfully replicates user behaviors, including attention switch, walking speed control, and reading. Please see our paper for more details!
