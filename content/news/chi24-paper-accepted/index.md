summary: Heads-Up Multitasker - Simulating Attention Switching On Optical Head-Mounted Displays
---


We propose a novel computationally rational model that features modeling users' attention switch when multitasking, especially in the context of reading on OHMDs while walking. We develop a hierarchical reinforcement learning architecture to capture users' key cognitive processes and realize them in a physics engine called MuJoCo. The model successfully replicates user behaviors, including attention switch, walking speed control, and reading. Please see our paper for more details!
